# Nutrition App

A personal Android app for losing weight: log what you eat, weigh in every morning, and get
calorie and macro targets that adjust every week based on how your weight is actually moving.
Steps and gym workouts come in automatically from Health Connect (Hevy writes workouts there), or
you can log a workout by hand.

Everything is stored on the phone. There's no account, no server and no login. Dark theme only
("Midnight Indigo" — periwinkle with a coral accent), regardless of your phone's setting.

## What it does

- **Food logging.** Search Open Food Facts (packaged products) or USDA (generic foods like
  chicken breast or rice), scan a barcode, or add a food from its label. Foods you've used show up
  under Recent and Favorites, so after a couple of weeks most logging is a few taps.
- **Describe what you ate.** Type a meal the way you'd say it ("5 spoons of cottage cheese 5% and
  2 eggs", "chicken breast 200g, 1 cup rice") and it's understood as you type: each food with its
  grams, calories and how the grams were worked out, ready to add in one tap. It's free and works
  offline (a built-in list of about 120 common and Israeli foods plus your own foods, no account
  or API key), and it learns: pick a different food or fix the grams once and next time your words
  and your spoon size are used.
- **Copy a day's meals.** Copy yesterday's whole day, one meal from yesterday, or a whole day or a
  single meal from any past date, into today (or whatever day you're viewing) — with an Undo
  snackbar after. An empty meal also gets a one-tap "Same as yesterday" chip.
- **Edit a past day.** The calendar icon on Today jumps to any earlier day to fix or fill in its
  meals; the arrows next to it step one day at a time (never past today).
- **Daily weigh-ins.** One weigh-in per day. The app smooths them into a trend line, so water and
  salt swings don't hide real progress.
- **Adaptive targets.** Each week (Sunday by default) the check-in compares what you ate on fully
  logged days with how your trend weight moved, estimates your real maintenance calories, and
  recommends new calories plus protein, fat and carbs for your chosen weekly loss rate.
- **Steps and workouts.** Steps and Hevy workouts are read from Health Connect every time the app
  opens. They're shown for context and are never added back to your calorie budget. You can also
  log a walk, run or other exercise by hand (speed/incline or a flat MET estimate, or just type the
  calories) for sessions Health Connect missed. Settings has a step-goal slider (3,000–20,000,
  default 10,000) and an optional walk reminder notification.
- **Recipes.** A browsable catalog of bundled recipes by meal (breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack), with
  search, filters by calorie/macro limits, and a "Recommended for you" row based on what's left of
  today's targets. Tap a recipe for its ingredients, steps and full macros.
- **Weight lifting.** Plan which exercises to do on a day (today or ahead), from your own exercise
  list or a saved preset such as "Push day", then track the reps and weight of every set. Each
  exercise shows all the sets you did last time.
- **Dashboard.** Weight trend, weekly intake against target, steps per day, workouts per week,
  lifting progress per exercise and the maintenance estimate over time.
- **Home-screen widget and lock-screen notification.** An Android home-screen widget shows
  calories left and today's steps. Since Android 15 removed lock-screen widgets, there's also an
  ongoing notification with the same steps-vs-goal and calories-left info, built natively so it can
  show a custom layout.
- **Export.** Settings → Export data writes everything to a JSON file you can save or share.

A web build usable from an iPhone is planned but not available yet.

## How the calorie recommendation works

1. **Start:** before there's enough data, maintenance = Mifflin-St Jeor BMR × your activity level.
2. **Learn:** once there are at least 7 fully logged days, 6 weigh-ins and a 10-day trend in the
   last 21 days, the app measures maintenance:
   `average intake − (trend weight change × 7700 kcal/kg) ÷ days`.
   It blends from the formula to the measured value as more logged days come in.
3. **Target:** maintenance minus the deficit for your weekly loss rate (0.25–1.0 % of body weight
   per week). The deficit is capped at 25 % of maintenance or 1000 kcal, and the target never drops
   below your BMR (or 1500 kcal for men, 1200 kcal for women).
4. **Macros:** protein 1.6–2.2 g per kg, fat is the larger of 0.8 g per kg and 25 % of calories,
   and carbs fill the rest (at least 50 g).
5. **Stability:** maintenance moves at most 150 kcal per week, and the target only changes when you
   accept the weekly check-in.

Only days you mark **"Day fully logged"** count. A day where you forgot dinner would otherwise make
it look like you eat less than you really do. The full spec is in [docs/engine.md](docs/engine.md).

## Installing on your phone

1. Download [`nutrition.apk`](https://github.com/DanielDaCool/nutrition-app/releases/download/latest-apk/nutrition.apk) — the `latest-apk` release, rebuilt from `main` on every push. The repo is
   public, so this works without being signed in to GitHub.
2. Open it on the phone and allow installing from that source.

For a pull request's build instead, open its run on the [Actions tab](https://github.com/DanielDaCool/nutrition-app/actions) and download the `nutrition-app-apk` artifact (needs a GitHub login), then copy `app-release.apk` to the phone.

**Keep your data between updates:** new versions only install over the old one if every build is
signed with the same key. Set these repository secrets once (Settings → Secrets and variables →
Actions):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | your release `.jks` file, base64-encoded |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | keystore password |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | key alias |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | key password |
| `USDA_API_KEY` | optional: free key from [api.data.gov](https://api.data.gov/signup/) (the shared demo key allows ~50 searches a day) |

Without the signing secrets, CI signs with a throwaway debug key and you'd have to uninstall
(losing your data) to install a newer build. Keep the `.jks` file and passwords backed up outside
the repo.

## Connecting Hevy and steps (Health Connect)

Health Connect is built into Android 14 and newer.

1. In the app: **Settings → Health Connect → Connect**, allow steps, exercise, distance and calories,
   then allow access to past data (this lets the first sync go back 90 days instead of 30).
2. **Steps:** Health Connect starts counting steps on the phone itself as soon as an app is allowed
   to read steps. Your old step counter app doesn't need to share anything. The two counts may differ
   slightly.
3. **Workouts:** in Hevy, turn on syncing to Health Connect. Hevy workouts then appear on the Today
   screen after the next sync. The sync runs whenever the app opens or comes back to the
   foreground, and there's also a Sync now button.

The `health` package doesn't pass through workout titles yet, so workouts show their type (for
example "Strength training") rather than the name you gave them in Hevy.

## Development

Requirements: Flutter **3.47.5** (Dart 3.13.4), and Android Studio or the Android SDK to build an APK.

```bash
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build   # after changing lib/data/db/tables.dart
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter run                   # with a phone connected (USB debugging on)
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=USDA_API_KEY=your_key
```

For local release signing, create `android/key.properties` (it's git-ignored):

```properties
storeFile=C:/path/to/release.jks
storePassword=...
keyAlias=...
keyPassword=...
```

```

Tech: Flutter, Riverpod 3 for state, Drift for the local database, `health` for Health Connect,
`mobile_scanner` for barcodes and `fl_chart` for charts.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push to `main` and every pull request. It checks that
the generated database code is up to date, then runs analyze and the tests, and builds the release
APK as a downloadable artifact. On a push to `main` it also publishes that APK to the `latest-apk`
GitHub release (see Installing, above).

## Data sources

- [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org): open database (ODbL). Crowd-sourced, so
  values can be wrong. When a product is missing or wrong, add it from its label as your own food.
- [USDA FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov): public domain (CC0).
